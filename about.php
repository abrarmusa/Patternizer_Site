		The patternizer is a prototype application that finds common regex patterns in logs.
		<br>
		<br>
		Here is a common use case:
		<br>
		The user will input a file or put some text into the textbox.
		<br>
		The most common patterns are generated in the next tab.
		<br>
		The user clicks the pattern that most closely matches what he/she is looking for.
		<br>
		The corresponding regex will show up in the output tab for the user to use at their own leisure.
